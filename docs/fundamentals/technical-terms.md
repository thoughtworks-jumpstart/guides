## API vs SDK

SDK includes the tools, libraries, simulators to develop for a particular environment, Node.js is not a SDK but there could be SDK developed for the Node.js SDK. For example, [Amazon AWS SDK for Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html).

There could be many APIs within SDK.
